all of these bookmarklets are currently working. if any of them dont work i will try to remove them from the list as soon as possible. 
i will try to update and add more bookmarklets regularly as soon as i find one that works.
if you are in a school district that blocks bookmarklets use this chromebook mod https://github.com/wicorn29/uWicLet
