all of these bookmarklets are currently working. if any of them dont work i will try to remove them from the list as soon as possible. 
i will try to update and add more bookmarklets regularly as soon as i find one that works.
if you are in a school district that blocks bookmarklets use this chromebook mod https://github.com/wicorn29/uWicLet
for those wondering how to use bookmarklets you can find instructions here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-bookmarklets/
if you are using uWicLet press shift+~ to open the menu. from there navigate up to the text box that says "enter bookmarklet code here" and enter the code for your bookmarklet. from there you will press "add bookmarklet" it will prompt you to name your bookmarklet. name it and click "ok" a new blue button will pop up on the menu with the name you chose. after you see this press on that button and uWickLet will run your bookmarklet for you.
